Branch 5075 of the Barbour County NAACP held its annual Freedom Fund Banquet at Lakepoint State Park this past Saturday October 7 th . The theme for this year’s event was “All Together for Justice”.  President Jewel Harris received welcome remarks from County Commissioner Francis Shipman, City Councilman Otis Hill, State Representative Barry Forte and President of the Alabama State NAACP Conference- Bernard Simelton. Guests were seated by members of Trio, a program housed at Wallace College, to support first generation college students. Vice President Mo Erkins was the master of ceremonies for the banquet. Aretha Bulter presented a musical section and here Husband Rev. Rick butler of Mt. Level Baptist church provided the invocation.

The branch welcomed Attorney Evan Milligan as the keynote speaker for the event. Mr. Milligan has been active in promoting voting rights in Alabama for a number of years. He is the current Executive Director of Alabama Forward- a statewide civic engagement network of nonpartisan organizations working together to improve Alabama. Mr. Milligan was the named plaintiff in the recent Allen vs Milligan case that went to the US Supreme Court. This case was decided in favor of the plaintive resulting in new boundaries for Alabama’s second Congressional District. With 49 % of registered voters in the District being of African American descent, there is a good chance the new district will have representation in congress more in line with the makeup of the state’s population. To that end voter registration is key as well as encouraging people to vote in 2024. The impact of this case is also likely to be felt in other states where gerrymandering has been used to limit the representation of minority populations.

The evening also honored Mr. Willie Shipman for his work as a past branch President and in organizing the Freedom Fund banquet for the last several years. The banquet is the primary fundraiser for the NAACP. Money raised support scholarships for local high school seniors and branch participation in community events.
