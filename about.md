Barbour County Branch 5075 of the NAAACP is looking for people of goodwill who believe in equal justice and equal opportunity for all citizens of Barbour County. Like all NAACP branches we are made up of many different committees that support the needs of everyday life. The branch promotes community involvement, education, and encourages the development of effective community leadership from underrepresented cultural groups. We are positioned to advocate for those that feel they have been discriminated against and to be a voice for positive change and inclusion in Barbour County.

The [NAACP](https://naacp.org/) (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) was founded in 1909 by a group of concerned citizens who felt that formerly enslaved people and their families were being treated unfairly. Of some 60 founding members of the NAACP only seven were black including W.E.B. DuBois, Ida B. Wells and Mary Church Terrell. Historically the organization has been a key voice in helping overturn Jim Crow laws, supporting the integration of the armed forces, and advancing voting rights. The NAACP has been a leader in the fight for Civil Rights with over 500,000 members worldwide.
