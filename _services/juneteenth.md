## The Problem 

Our county is diverse but in many cases community wide activities and events do not celebrate our diversity. 

## What we are doing 

The branch is promoting a community wide Juneteenth Celebration this year working with other key community stakeholders. In addition, the branch participates directly in multiple community activities to foster cultural inclusion.
